# simple-java-encoder
One of the assessments from DXC for Java Developer - Fresh Graduate. A simple java encoder.

**Requirement:**
You are to write an encoder that takes in a plaintext and
encode it to another obfuscated string. The logic of the
encoding / decoding is given below:

**Logic:**
Choose **any** character in the reference table as the offset.
The **first character** of the encoded message will be the
offset character. Any character not in the reference table
will mapped back to the same character.

For example, if the offset character is **B**, the entire table
will shift by **1** element down (Refer to Shift Table #1).
Thus, given the plaintext *HELLO WORLD*, it will be
encoded as **B**GDKKN VNQKC:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | H | E | L | L | O |  | W | O | R | L | D |
| **B** | G | D | K | K | N | V | N | Q | K | C |

Letâ€™s take **F** as the offset character for another example.
The entire table will shift **5** elements down (Refer to Shift
Table #2). Given the same plaintext, the encoded
message will be:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | H | E | L | L | O |  | W | O | R | L | D |
| **F** | C | / | G | G | J | R | J | M | G | . |

To decode it, you need to take the first character for
offset and match it backwards to get the original
plaintext.

**Constraints:**
The solution must implement the following 2 methods:

public String encode (String plainText);

public String decode (String encodedText);

**Bonus:**
The solution should also demonstrate the concept of
OOP

**To run**:
```sh
cd out/production/encoder/
java Main
```
